# Bitcoin library written in Python

Bitcoin library developed in Python based on Jimmy Song's [Programming Bitcoin book](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Bitcoin-Learn-Program-Scratch/dp/1492031496). After taking Jimmy's excellent 2-day course, I decided to re-write the library in which his course is based to strengthen my understanding of all the topics covered in the course. This library is the result of that effort.

## Running the tests

To run the tests for each of the library's files, run the following commands in your terminal:

```
python3 -m unittest <nameoffile.py>
```
